# 3DOF Robotic Arm

_explore robotic arms in the comfort of your blankets_

## Purpose

This project demonstrates the design and development of a three degrees of freedom (3DOF) robotic arm.  
The primary aim is to provide a low-cost, scalable, and modular prototype for studying robotic kinematics, dynamics, and control.  
It also serves as an educational tool for understanding concepts such as forward and inverse kinematics, torque requirements, workspace analysis, and actuator selection.

## Milestones

- Designed the 3DOF robotic arm structure using CAD tools.
- Simulated kinematic and dynamic behavior of the arm under varying loads.
- Integrated end-effector models and considered additional payload conditions.
- Derived essential equations for torque, angular acceleration, moment of inertia, and power.
- Prepared the foundation for physical prototyping with accessible materials.

## Tech Stack

- **Modeling and Simulation**: Fusion 360, MATLAB/Simulink.
- **Programming and Control**: Python, C for embedded systems.
- **Electronics**: Basic actuators, motor drivers, microcontrollers (Arduino/STM32).
- **Mathematics**: Kinematic equations, torque and power relations, workspace optimization.

## Future

- Extend the design to higher degrees of freedom for advanced manipulation tasks.
- Implement feedback control systems with encoders and sensors.
- Incorporate computer vision for autonomous object detection and handling.
- Explore lightweight yet strong material alternatives for increased efficiency.
- Develop a complete simulation-to-prototype pipeline to accelerate research and education.
